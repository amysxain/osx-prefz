Description:
    Autumna is a color scheme for Aptana to give it
    a nice dark, autumn'ish feel. 

Installation:

- In Aptana, go to: Window > Preferences.
- In the search box in the upper left of the dialog that comes up, type in “colors”. This’ll hide almost all the fields you’re not interested in.
- For each language listed under Aptana > Editors, there will be a “Colors” node. When you click on each, you’ll see an “Import…” button that will allow you to install the color scheme for the language.

    would be nice if you mention me, if you're feeling kind.
